This is my first post! I would like to reflect on some topics that I was discussing with my mathematician friends.

What is mathematics about?

What is mathematics about? We, (aspiring) mathematicians, know that it is certainly not about doing arithmetic and/or being a human calculator.
Some of my friends said that mathematics is about solving problems, and I think I agree with that.

One thing we all agreed on was that a mathematician is, by nature (or definition?) a curious being. It is this curiosity that fuels and powers the undying desire to dig deeper, to discover new things, to explain unknown things, to discover new mathematics.

I do not think that this question will ever be fully answered, but I also think that mathematicians will never stop trying to answer it, just as they will never stop doing mathematics.

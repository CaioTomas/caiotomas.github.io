Seminar given in the Mechanics session of the XV Summer Workshop in Mathematics of the University of Brasília.
In this talk, I presented some results of the numerical study of a bi-disperse magnetic granular system
(i.e., a system composed of magnets of two different sizes). This work is a collaboration with professor Felipe Pacheco-Vázquez
from the University of Puebla, México, and professor Hiroaki Katsuragi, from Osaka University.

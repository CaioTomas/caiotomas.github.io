Poster presented at the XLI CNMAC, hosted at the State University of Campinas in 2022. This presentation is a first result of my research as an undergraduate, under the supervision of professor Yuri Dumaresq Sobral of the University of Brasília. In the poster I argue that the quantitative discrepancy shown in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10035-022-01268-w) is not resolved when we model the walls as finite and also suggesting that, for the scales our system is in, the walls can be thought of as virtually infinite. You can read the poster [here](http://caiotomas.github.io/files/poster_CNMAC22_vF.pdf), and you can reach me via email (which can be found on the left side of this page) if you would like to discuss ideas or clear any doubts.

### Hi there! My name is Caio Tomás. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am currently a Master's student of Applied Mathematics at the University of Brasília and an Analyst at the Serviço Federal de Processamento de Dados (Serpro).

I'm really passionated about math and science. If you let me, I'll speak hours non stop about these topics!

I'm interested in Fluid Dynamics/Mechanics, Granular Materials, Data Science and data-driven approaches to applied problems.

Current and previous work
======

- 🔭🧲 I'm currently on a research project on the compression of a granular layer composed of repelling magnetic particles, under the orientation of professor Yuri Dumaresq Sobral (here's his [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2148849606092346), [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuri-Sobral) and [website](http://yuri.mat.unb.br/)).

- 🤝🏼  I’m looking forward to collaborate on anything that involves at least a little bit of math or physics (or math and physics)!

- I have also done other research projects while an undergrad at UnB. You can check them in detail at my [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3803046005556999). Here is the list of them, with the topics of research resumed for the sake of brevity and ordered older to recent:

  - I did a PIBIC (*Institutional Program of Scientific Initiation Scholarships*, in free translation) on **Knot and Braid Theory** under the orientation of professor Sheila Campos Chagas (here's her [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3851790594023130) and [website](https://www.mat.unb.br/~sheila/)) (August 2019 - September 2020);
  
  - I did a research on **Projective Geometry** under the orientation of professor Lucas Conque Seco Ferreira (here's his [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/9312332483222873)) (September 2020 - November 2020);
  
  - I did another research under the orientation of professor Lucas on **The 3 constant curvature geometries as subgeometries of the Projective Geometry**, collaborating with my colleague and friend, Matheus de Freitas Souza (here's his [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1097350416973041)) (January 2021 - May 2021);
  
  - More recently, I did a research on **The formalism of Special Relativity**, under the orientation of professor Luciana Maria Dias de Ávila Rodrigues (here's her [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6564647402919278)) (June 2021 - November 2021);

In various types of many-particle systems, bidispersity is frequently used to avoid spontaneous ordering in particle configurations. In this study, the relation between bidispersity and disorder degree of particle configurations is investigated. By using magnetic dipole–dipole interaction, magnet particles are dispersed in a two-dimensional cell without any physical contact between them. In this magnetic system, bidispersity is introduced by mixing large and small magnets. Then, the particle system is compressed to produce a uniform particle configuration. The compressed particle configuration is analyzed by using Voronoi tessellation for evaluating the disorder degree, which strongly depends on bidispersity. Specifically, the standard deviation and skewness of the Voronoi cell area distribution are measured. As a result, we find that the peak of standard deviation is observed when the numbers of large and small particles are almost identical. Although the skewness shows a non-monotonic behavior, a zero skewness state (symmetric distribution) can be achieved when the numbers of large and small particles are identical. In this ideally random (disordered) state, the ratio between pentagonal, hexagonal, and heptagonal Voronoi cells becomes roughly identical, while hexagons are dominant under monodisperse (ordered) conditions. The relation between Voronoi cell analysis and the global bond orientational order parameter is also discussed.
